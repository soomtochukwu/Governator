## Project Description

Governator is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to facilitate open governance in African electoral processes. By leveraging blockchain technology, Governator enables secure voter registration, anonymous voting, and transparent vote collation, including the participation of diaspora voters. Governator ensures the anonymity of all cast votes through smart contracts, thereby enhancing trust, fairness, and participation in elections across Africa.

## Key Features

- **NFT Minting**: Upon registration, users receive an NFT with a unique identity number, which can be added to their wallet immediately after signing up.
- **Anonymous Voting**: Ensures voter identities remain confidential, preventing potential coercion or manipulation.
- **Fair Elections**: Eliminates biases, ensuring that all votes carry equal weight.
- **NFT-Based Voting Rights**:
  - **Tokenization**: Each registered voter is minted a unique NFT, acting as a digital passport to participate in elections.
  - **Proof of Ownership**: NFTs provide verifiable proof of voting rights, preventing fraud and double voting.
- **Decentralized Governance**:
  - **Community-Driven**: Elections can be initiated and concluded by the community, ensuring democratic control.
  - **Transparency**: All voting activities, including election results and moderator selections, are publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Moderator Selection**:
  - **Democratic Process**: Moderators are chosen through a transparent voting mechanism, ensuring accountability and fairness.
  - **Oversight**: Moderators oversee the election process, ensuring compliance with established rules.
